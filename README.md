## Introduction
In the realm of 3D computing, scanning real-world objects to create accurate three-dimensional models is a fundamental task. This project leverages the triangulation approach, a common technique used in computer vision, to automate the process of object scanning. By capturing multiple viewpoints of an object and analyzing the resulting images, a detailed 3D model can be reconstructed.

## Features
- Automatic 3D object scanning using the triangulation approach
- Generation of basic-quality 3D models
- Support for various input devices such as cameras or depth sensors
- Integration with popular 3D applications for further processing
- Efficient and optimized algorithms for accurate reconstruction
- Customizable settings for controlling the scanning process
- Export options for STL 3D file format

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzafijahi2001/SCANNER-3D.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 3D-scanning-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the project settings as needed.

5. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
To use this 3D object scanning project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your preferred input device (camera or depth sensor) and ensure it is connected to your computer.

2. Launch the scanning application and configure the desired settings, such as resolution, scanning speed, or reconstruction quality.

3. Position the object to be scanned within the field of view of the input device.

4. Initiate the scanning process and allow the system to capture multiple viewpoints of the object.

5. Once the scanning is complete, the system will automatically reconstruct a three-dimensional model based on the captured data.

6. Export the resulting 3D model to your preferred format (e.g., OBJ, STL) for further usage in compatible 3D applications.

## Examples
Here are a few examples demonstrating the potential applications of this project:

1. **3D Printing**: Scan real-world objects to create accurate models that can be 3D printed.

2. **Virtual Reality**: Generate 3D models of physical environments or objects for immersive virtual reality experiences.

3. **Archaeology and Cultural Preservation**: Digitally preserve artifacts or historical sites by scanning them in three dimensions.

4. **Product Design**: Create digital prototypes of physical products to visualize and refine designs before manufacturing.

5. **Gaming and Animation**: Scan real objects or characters to integrate them into video games or animated movies.
